Weather-API-with-Auth

This app consumes API from Weather Service API and shows the results on the page.

It also provides a feature of authentication with login and registration through local storage and store the past results in local storage as well.

Once you click on any city from past searches it redirects to the current weather in that city.

Scope of improvement:

1. Store results in cache for better performance.
2. Calling city API instead of hardcoded cities.
